## Introduction

.leftcol[
This paper addressed the impacts of **child birth** in rural China on following dimensions:

1. Parents’ labor supply
2. Household income &amp; expenditure
3. Time use

Past literature on child penalty:

- Denmark (Kleven, Landais, and Søgaard 2019; AEJ: Applied)
- Sweden (Angelov, Johansson, and Lindahl 2016; JLE)
]

This paper addressed the impacts of child birth on 3 dimensions:

1. Parents' labor supply
2. Household income &amp; expenditure
3. time use

This paper echo with the child penalty literature established by a Denmark research published on AEJ Applied in 2019 and a Swedish research on Journal of Labor Economics in 2016.
Basically an event-study that makes with-in parent comparisons before and after a child has been born.
Both of them addressed the gender gap in wage, income, labor force participation created by the birth of child in Nordic countries.

Feature in rural Chinese households:

1. Family cooperation (direction of child effect goes opposite)
2. Heterogeneous child penalty by **gender of the child**

???

But this paper stands out with some unique stories in rural Chinese families.

First they observed a opposite trend for mother and father after a child has been born, instead of only mothers receiving "penalties". 

Secondly, there's heterogeneous child effect by the gender of the child. Saying that having a son or having a daughter would lead to different consequences of the parents.

## Data

.leftcol[
National Fixed Point Survey (NFP)

- Individual-level panel data from 2003 to 2010
- Mainly **rural** households
- Unbalanced panel, 2285 births observed
- Imputed birth year of child
- Outcomes: labor supply, household expenditure
]

???

The main data the author used is called National Fixed Point Survey, conducted by Ministry of Agricultural in China.

It's an individual level panel data spanned from 2003 to 2010 and covers mainly rural households.

And it's an unbalanced panel with more than 2000 births observed. Not as much as administrative data we're utilizing in Taiwan of course.

Through imputation they can construct the birth year of child and they have key outcome variables like labor supply and household expenditure.

![Summary Statistics (NFP)](20230131-wang-child-penalty-china.assets/summary-nfp.png)
]

Women:

- Mostly works in family occupation
- Labor supply is determined by household arrangements more than labor market conditions
- Labor force drop-out is not induced by rigidity (unlike Nordic)

???

This is the summary statistics for NFP sample. 

An important and interesting point is that nearly 60% of women in the data is working in family enterprise. And nearly half of them is working in agriculture.

This is saying that labor supply is determined by internal household arrangements more than external labor market conditions.
For example, drop-out of labor force would reflect rearrangement in family labor instead of rigidity (like lacking of flexible measures for parents).

name: CHNS

## Data

.leftcol[
China Health and Nutrition Survey
- 10 waves, 1989 to 2015
- Limited to rural households
- Unbalanced panel
- Used for time-use, household decision-making outcomes
]

???

The next set of data is China Health and Nutrition Survey, which has been conducted 10 waves from 1989 to 2015.
Sample was limited to rural households and it's an unbalanced panel.

--

.rightcol[
![Summary Statistics (CHNS)](20230131-wang-child-penalty-china.assets/summary-chns.png)
]

???

The main focus here is that the women that's going to have a boy and women before getting a daughter is very much the same.

We'll come back to this later to see why it's important.

## Empirical Specification

Event-study model:

`$$y_{it}=\alpha+\sum_{j=-3}^7 \beta_j \text { Birth }_{it, j} + \tau_t + \gamma_i+\epsilon_{i t}$$`

for individual `\(i\)` at calendar year `\(t\)`, event time `\(j\)`.

- Event study, j = -3 ~ 7
- `\(\beta_{-1}\)` was omitted as benchmark. 
- Standard errors are clustered at individual level.

???

The empirical specification is a standard event-study twoway fixed effect model that regress outcome on discrete event time from 3 years before birth to 7 years after birth.

Year -1 was omitted as a benchmark period.

## Empirical Results

### Labor Force Participation

.leftcol[
Women LFP
![Labor Force Participation - Women](20230131-wang-child-penalty-china.assets/image-20230128211154418.png)
10% ↓ post birth
]

.rightcol[
Men LFP
![Labor Force Participation - Men](20230131-wang-child-penalty-china.assets/image-20230128211216060.png)
2.4% ↑ post birth
]

???

Now these two graph presents the coefficient estimate for labor force participation. The left hand side is for women and right hand side is for men.

You can see that in the left hand side, women's labor force participation drop significantly once they have a child and goes downward until 1 years after the birth. The participation recovers rather quickly that 4 years after the birth it goes nearly to the original level.

On the right hand side, the labor force participation for men increased significantly after 1 year of birth and recovers at roughly 3 to 4 years after birth.

The magnitude of the change would be 10% decrease for women and 2.4% increase for men, which is a number smaller than Nordic countries.

## Empirical Results

### Heterogeneous Effect by Gender of Child

Identify the “son effect” using:

`$$y_{i t}=\alpha+\sum_{j=-3}^7 \beta_j \text { Birth}_{i t, j} \times \text { Son}_i+\sum_{j=-3}^7 \delta_j \text { Birth}_{i t, j}+\tau_t+\gamma_i+\epsilon_{i t}$$`

???

Now the author tries to identify heterogeneous "son effect" by adding an interaction term of child's gender.

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Heterogeneous Effect by Gender of Child&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

???

On the upper left graph, mothers do work less after having a child. But, as you can see on the upper right, if the child is a son, then the magnitude of the reduction is bigger.

And for men, there's no this kind of heterogeneous effect created by the birth of a son.

#### Gender of child might be endogenous

- Families that are sex-selecting a son might prefer women being as housewife, not working women.
- Assumption: household gender preference is time-invariant.
	- Panel data w/ fixed effect would capture this household characteristic.
- Robustness Check
	1. [No significant difference](#CHNS) in pre-birth characteristics between son v.s. daughter group
	2. Parallel pre-trend
	3. Sub-sample of first-born children: less skewed sex ratio
	4. Artificially balance the sex ratio by assigning male births to female births

???

However there's one concern about the identification of heterogeneous effect. That is, the gender of child might be endogenous, especially in countries like China that sex-selective abortion is a common practice.

In this case, families that are sex-selecting a son might prefer women being as housewife, not working women because of their gender preference. And the estimation of son effect would be upward biased.

So the assumption here would be that household gender preference is time-invariant. Then by the nature of panel data and fixed effect estimator, it would capture this household characteristic and provide more robust estimation.

The author has also done some robustness check, ...

Artificially balance the sex ratio by reassigning male births to female births to obtain conservative results and finds it similar.

## Mechanism

What makes mothers work less when having a son compared with having a daughter?

.leftcol[
### Investment in Son?

Marginal return of childcare investment in sons &gt; investment in daughters.

#### Test

Gender gap in other types of observable investments: cigarette/dairies/meat consumption

- No difference except reduced cigarette consumption
- No additional childcare hours for son
]

???

Now we can discuss the mechanism that makes mothers work less when having a son compared with having a daughter.

One explanation is that marginal return to childcare investment in sons is higher than in daughters. So mothers would be arranged to stay at home.

If this explanation is true, then there should be gender gaps in other types of observable investments, too.

But the data shows no difference in consumption expect reduced cigarette consumption when having a son.

And there's no additional childcare hours while having a male baby.

.rightcol[
### Household Preference for Mother with Son?

&gt; 能生兒子的媳婦才是好媳婦

In son-preferring families, mothers are rewarded for producing a son.

#### Empirical Evidence

For mothers after the birth of **a son**:

1. ↓ Agricultural work
2. ↑ Mothers’ education
3. ↑ Participation in household decision-making
4. ↑ Leisure
]

???

Another possible explanation is that households has preference over wives that brings them son.
So when mothers are having a male birth, she would be rewarded with reduced laboring and increased leisure or personal investments.

There are some empirical evidences observed in the data that support this explanation, including that mothers take less agricultural work and having more education.
She participates more in household decision making (household purchasing) and having more leisure time.

Overall, the explanation of households having preference over mothers with son is more likely to be true.

---

## Conclusions

- Child penalty in Denmark are larger in magnitude and more persistent in time.
	- **Denmark**: Induced by rigidity in formal sector job / discrimination against mothers.
	- **Rural China**: Labor division between husband and wife.
- Mothers are rewarded more for having a son.
  - A realization of household gender preference.
