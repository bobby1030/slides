# Introduction

Taiwanese women have a relatively well socioeconomic status:

- \textcolor{mLightBrown}{Gender Inequality Index}: top 1 among Asian societies
- \textcolor{mLightBrown}{> 40\% female legislators}: close to Scandinavian countries

What factors contributed to these achievements?

---

## Woman Reserved Seats in Taiwan

- Implemented since 1946, at national legislators and county councilors elections
- For every 4 political seats (or 5 before 1999), 1 seat is reserved for female candidates.
- 14% ~ 25% female councilor for constituencies with $\geq$ 4 seats
- Elected man with lowest vote share get replaced by unelected woman with highest vote share.

## Impact of Quota Policy in India

Policy intervention randomly reserves village head for female:

- Reduced bias toward female leader's performance
- Girls are more likely to enroll in schools
- Gender gap in educational attainment get closed
- Decreased mortality of higher-order girls
- More women running small business

Let woman becomes political leaders reduces gender gap well beyond political field.

## This paper

Examine the casual relationship between \textcolor{mLightBrown}{female political representativeness} and \textcolor{mLightBrown}{son preference}

- A changing and prominent phenomenon of Taiwanese society
- An indicator for more general gender attitudes

---

## Data on Political Representativeness

- Councilor election result from Central Election Committee
- Election years: 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006

## Treatment: % Female Elected

$$
\text{\% Female Elected}_{td} = \cfrac{\text{\# Female Elected}_{td}}{\text{\# Total Seats}_{td}}
$$
for year $t$, constituency (electoral district) $d$

- Omitted variable bias: Cultural norm that has less son preference and less bias toward female politician.
- Instrumental variable approach is used to deal with endogeneity.

---

# Instrumental Variable Design

## Source of Exogenous Variation: Woman Reserved Seats

Define instrument as

$$
\text{\% Reserved Seats}_{td} = \cfrac{\text{\# Reserved Seats}_{td}}{\text{\# Total Seats}_{td}} 
$$

which is determined by population size.

Utilizing local variation in population between constituencies gives us exogenous variation in reserved seats and female elected.

```

However, IV correlated not only with female \textcolor{mLightBrown}{elected} but also \textcolor{mLightBrown}{candidates}.

1st stage and reduced form estimates are presented throughout this paper.

# Outcome

## Fertility of 3rd child

$$
\text{Child3}_{itcd} = \mathbb{1}\{\text{3rd child is born at time } t \}
$$
for mother $i$, living in county $c$, constituency $d$

- An indicator for son preference
  - Strong son preference at 3rd child
  - Mothers with 2 daughters would like to have 3rd child
- Data gathered from MOI birth record
  - Panel data from 1994 â€” 2006, each observation linked to most recent electoral result with 1 year lag
  - Sample consists of mothers with 2 children, not yet having 3rd

# Regression Specification

## First Stage

$$
\text{Treatment}_{itcd} = \alpha + \beta \text{\% Reserved Seats}_{tcd} + \mathbf{X}_i \Gamma + \mathbf{X}_{tcd} \rho + \delta_t + \delta_c + \varepsilon_{itcd}
$$

## Reduced Form

$$
\text{Child3}_{itcd} = \alpha + \beta \text{\% Reserved Seats}_{tcd} \times \text{Sex Composition}_i + \mathbf{X}_i \Gamma + \mathbf{X}_{tcd} \rho + \delta_t + \delta_c + \varepsilon_{itcd}
$$

# Mechanism Discussion

## Benefit-Cost Hypothesis
- Satisfied with daughters due to improved career prospect
  - Female councilors delivering beliefs of promising future
- Daughters being more "valuable"
- **Test**: Gender gap in health investment

## Intrahousehold Bargaining Hypothesis
- Men like to have sons, but women simply prefer less children
- When women are gaining awareness in participating household decisions, her preference are more likely to be realized.
- **Test**: Gender division in household decision making

---

# Test for Benefit-Cost Hypothesis

## NHRI Mortality Record
- Outcome: Neonatal mortality
- Period: 2000 - 2008
- Boys and girls aged under 3
- Outcome = 1 if he/she dies under 3 years old, 0 otherwise.

# Conclusions

- Increasing female political representativeness has an impact on family birth decision
- 3rd parity fertility decreased for mothers without son.
- Female gaining more awareness in decision making which affects joint decision (including birth) outcome
