# Introduction

Taiwanese women have a relatively well socioeconomic status:

- \textcolor{mLightBrown}{Gender Inequality Index}: Ranked as 6th place globally, top 1 among Asian societies
- \textcolor{mLightBrown}{> 40\% female legislators}: close to Scandinavian countries

What factors contributed to these achievements?

## Woman Reserved Seats in Taiwan

- Implemented since 1946, at national and county representatives elections
- For every 4 political seats (or 5 before 1999), 1 seat is reserved for female candidates.
- 14% ~ 25% female councilor for constituencies with $\geq$ 4 seats
- Man with lowest vote share get replaced by woman with highest vote share.

---

## Impact of Quota Policy in India

Policy intervention randomly reserves village head for female:

- Reduced bias toward female leader's performance
- Girls are more likely to enroll in schools
- Gender gap in educational attainment get closed
- Decreased mortality of higher-order girls
- More women running small business

Let woman becomes political leaders reduces gender gap well beyond political field.

## This paper

Examine the casual impact between \textcolor{mLightBrown}{political seats reservation} and \textcolor{mLightBrown}{son preference}

- A changing and prominent phenomenon of Taiwanese society
- A behavioral indicator for gender attitudes

# Data and Identification Strategy

## Data

- Councilor elections
- 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006

## Instrument: % of reserved seats

- $Z_{ed} = \frac{\text{\# Reserved Seats}}{\text{Total Seats}}$, in election year $e$, electoral district $d$
- Determined by population size of electoral district.

## Potential Treatments

1. % female elected
2. % female candidates

Both could affect outcomes. Exclusion restriction not satisfied. Thus I’ll present 1st stage and reduced form.

# Main Outcome

## 3rd parity fertility (conditional on sex composition of first 2 children)
- An indicator for son preference
  - Mothers without son for first 2 parities likely to have additional birth
  - Strong sex selective practice in 3rd parity
- Data gathered from MOI birth record
  - 1994 - 2006, each observation merged with most recent electoral result with 1 year lag
  - Sample consists of mothers with 2 children, not yet having 3rd
  - Outcome = 1 if mother give birth 3rd child at year $t$, 0 otherwise.

# Mechanism Discussion

## Benefit-Cost Hypothesis
- Willing to have daughter due to improved career prospect
- Daughters being more "valuable"
- **Test**: Gender gap in health investment

## Intrahousehold Bargaining
- Women preferred less children while men like to have sons
- Woman gains bargaining power, then her preference realized.
- **Test**: Household decision making

# Test for Benefit-Cost Hypothesis

## NHRI Mortality Record
- Outcome: Neonatal mortality
- Period: 2000 - 2008
- Boys and girls aged under 3
- Outcome = 1 if he/she dies under 3 years old, 0 otherwise.
