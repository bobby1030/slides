# Introduction

- Market of pharmacies and physicians in Belgium
- Impact of geographical entry restriction
    - Limiting max. number of pharmacies per municipalities
    - ***Does it provide higher consumer welfare when the restriction is lifted?***
        1. Availability
        2. Markup

---

## Interaction

1. Geographical: 
    - A market with highly locality, since no advertising is allowed
    - Defined at township level (smaller than municipalities)
    - Exclude urban towns to avoid overlapping
2. Within profession:
    - **strategic substitutes**
    - No price competition: \textcolor{gray}{fixed price (markup) negotiated through social insurance regime}
    - No advertising competition
    - Within profession competition is limited
3. Between profession:
    - **strategic complementary**

# Entry Game

type $1$ = pharmacies, type $2$ = physicians

Payoff function:

$$
\pi^{*}_i (N_1, N_2) = 
\underbrace{\pi_i(N_1, N_2)}_{\text{Determined by covariates}} 
- \underbrace{\varepsilon_i}_{\text{Random part}}
$$

Firm enters the market if $\pi^{*}_i > 0$.

## Nash Equilibrium of $N_1, N_2$ Under Free Entry

$(n_1, n_2)$ is a Nash equilibrium if and only if:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\pi_1(n_1 + 1, n_2) < \varepsilon_1 \leq \pi_1(n_1, n_2) \\
\pi_2(n_1, n_2 + 1) < \varepsilon_2 \leq \pi_2(n_1, n_2)
\end{aligned}
$$

However, this may show multiplicity.

### Multiple Equilibrium

- By assuming **sequential entry**, subgame perfect Nash equilibrium predicts higher number of firms would be realized.
- Prob. dist. for outcome $(n_1, n_2)$ is now well-defined:
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \operatorname{Pr}\left(N_1=n_1, N_2=n_2\right)=& \int_{\pi_1\left(n_1+1, n_2\right)}^{\pi_1\left(n_1, n_2\right)} \int_{\pi_2\left(n_1, n_2+1\right)}^{\pi_2\left(n_1, n_2\right)} f\left(u_1, u_2\right) \mathrm{d} u_1 \mathrm{~d} u_2 \\
        &-\int_{\pi_1\left(n_1+1, n_2\right)}^{\pi_1\left(n_1+1, n_2+1\right)} \int_{\pi_2\left(n_1, n_2+1\right)}^{\pi_2\left(n_1+1, n_2+1\right)} f\left(u_1, u_2\right) \mathrm{d} u_1 \mathrm{~d} u_2 .
    \end{aligned}
    $$

## Nash Equilibrium of $N_1, N_2$ Under Restriction

By restriction $N_1 = \bar{n}_1$,

$(\bar{n}_1, n_2)$ is a Nash equilibrium if and only if:

$$
\begin{aligned}
                            &\varepsilon_1 \leq \pi_1(\bar{n}_1, n_2) \\
\pi_2(\bar{n}_1, n_2 + 1) < &\varepsilon_2 \leq \pi_2(\bar{n}_1, n_2)
\end{aligned}
$$

# Econometric Specefication

$$
\begin{aligned}
\pi^{*}_i(N_1, N_2) = 
    & \lambda_1 \ln(S)      & \small\text{Market size} \\
    & + X \beta_i           & \small\text{Market characteristics} \\
    & - \alpha^j_i          & \small\text{Own-type FE} \\
    & + \gamma^k_i / N_i    & \small\text{Other-type complementary FE} \\
    & - \varepsilon_i
\end{aligned}
$$

# Conclusions

- Impacts of entry restriction:
    - Direct: Reduce pharmacies
    - Indirect: Reduce physicians
- \textcolor{teal}{Liberalizing entry restrictions} and \textcolor{teal}{lowering regulated markup} simultaneously would transfer welfare to consumers.

\appendix

To model "markup drop", authors rewrite pharmacies' payoff function into:

$$
\Pi^{*}_i(N_1, N_2) = S \mu R(N_1, N_2) \exp(-\varepsilon_1) - F_1(N_1, N_2)
$$

where $\mu$ is markup rate.

It's equivalent to consider alternative payoff function:

$$
\pi_1^*\left(N_1, N_2\right) =
    \ln (S)+\ln (\mu)
    + \underbrace{\ln \left(R\left(N_1, N_2\right) / F_1\left(N_1, N_2\right)\right)}_{\text{Determined by covariates}}
    - \varepsilon_1 \geq 0
$$
